    <h1>Privacy Policy for Note26</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: November 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Note26</strong> (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our services.</p>
    <p>By using Note26, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <li>Calendar entries or daily planning data</li>
      <li>Optional metadata (timestamps, device info for debugging)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Authentication Data</h3>
    <p>If you sign in using Apple Sign-In or Google Sign-In, we receive:</p>

      <li>Email address (which may be a private relay from Apple)</li>
      <li>User name (optional)</li>

    <p>We may collect certain information automatically when you use the App, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
      <li>Anonymous usage analytics (e.g. screens visited, basic interaction events)</li>
      <li>Crash logs and performance data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used to improve stability, performance, and the overall user experience.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core functionality such as notes, reminders, and calendar features</li>
      <li>Sync your content across devices when you are signed in</li>
      <li>Maintain and secure your account</li>
      <li>Diagnose bugs, crashes, and performance issues</li>
      <li>Understand usage patterns to improve Note26</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information or share it with third-party advertisers.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage (Firebase / Firestore)</h2>
    <p>Note26 uses cloud infrastructure provided by Google through Firebase services, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cloud Firestore</strong> for storing notes, reminders, and app settings</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> for account login and identity management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your data may be processed or stored on servers located outside your country of residence. All communication with Firebase is encrypted in transit, and data is encrypted at rest where supported by the service.</p>

    <h2>4. Ownership of Your Content</h2>
    <p>All notes, reminders, and personal content you create in Note26 remain <strong>your property</strong>. We store this data only to operate the App and provide features such as sync and backup.</p>
    <p>You may request deletion of your account and related data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@note26.com">support@note26.com</a>. After verification, we will delete or anonymize your data within a reasonable period, except where we are required to retain it by law.</p>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>Note26 offers auto-renewing monthly subscriptions, including Starter and Plus plans.</p>

    <h3>5.1 Auto-Renewal</h3>
    <p>Subscriptions automatically renew each month unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Payment Processing</h3>
    <p>Payments are processed by Apple. The purchase is charged to your Apple ID account at the time of confirmation. We do not store your full payment card details on our servers.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Managing or Canceling Your Subscription</h3>
    <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your Apple ID account settings on your device. Deleting the App does not automatically cancel an active subscription.</p>

    <h3>5.4 Refunds</h3>
    <p>Refunds for in-app purchases and subscriptions are handled by Apple according to their policies. We do not process refunds directly.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Note26 is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including encryption in transit and secure access controls.</p>
    <p>However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of Note26 after any changes means you accept the revised Policy.</p>
