    <p class="meta">Last updated: November 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Note26</strong> (“the App”). These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the App and related services. By downloading or using Note26, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>Note26 provides tools for daily planning, reminders, and note-taking. You may use the App only for lawful and personal purposes.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. Subscription Plans</h2>
    <p>Note26 offers auto-renewing monthly subscription plans, including Starter and Plus. These plans may unlock additional features such as increased reminder limits and advanced calendar views.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Auto-Renewal and Billing</h3>
    <p>Subscriptions are billed through your Apple ID account and renew automatically each month unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</p>
    <p>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Prices and available plans may change over time; any changes will apply on your next billing period after notice, where required by law.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Managing or Canceling Your Subscription</h3>
    <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID account settings on your device. Deleting the App does not automatically cancel your subscription.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Refunds</h3>
    <p>Refunds for subscriptions and in-app purchases are handled exclusively by Apple according to their policies. We do not process refunds directly.</p>

    <h2>3. User Content</h2>
    <p>You retain full ownership of the notes, reminders, and other content you create in Note26 (“User Content”).</p>
    <p>By using the App, you grant Note26 a limited, non-exclusive license to store, process, and display your User Content solely for the purpose of operating and improving the service (such as syncing across devices and providing backups).</p>
    <p>We do not claim ownership of your User Content and do not use it for advertising or resale.</p>

    <h2>4. Accounts and Authentication</h2>
    <p>Note26 may allow you to sign in using Apple Sign-In or Google Sign-In to sync data across devices.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. If you suspect unauthorized use of your account, you should inform Apple and/or Google and stop using the App until the issue is resolved.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Privacy</h2>
    <p>We store data using Firebase services provided by Google, including Cloud Firestore and Firebase Authentication. Your use of the App is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Note26 Inc. and its owners, employees, and partners shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, revenue, or profits, arising out of your use of or inability to use the App.</p>
    <p>The App is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>

    <h2>7. Service Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (or any part of it) at any time, with or without notice. We are not liable to you or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuation of the service.</p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
